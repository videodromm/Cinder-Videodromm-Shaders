# Cinder-Videodromm-Shaders
Cinder block to test shaders on multiple platforms, will be integrated to Cinder-Videodromm block later

This is a block from @ulyssesp (https://github.com/ulyssesp) code:  https://github.com/ulyssesp/oschader-cinder
If you create a new project using Tinderbox, delete the assets folder, the assets are common to all VideoDromm projects, so clone/fork https://github.com/videodromm/assets
